\ (backslash) — Trigger Inline Suggestions

- Press \ in the editor to trigger inline suggestions.
- This binds to VS Code's `editor.action.inlineSuggest.trigger` command so any inline-suggestion provider (including Copilot) should respond.
- If it doesn't work: open Command Palette -> `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` and confirm the binding is present, then reload the window.
